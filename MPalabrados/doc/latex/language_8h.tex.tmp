\subsection*{Clases}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classLanguage}{Language}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Class fully implemented. It is used to store and manage all the details concerning a given language. It includes and make it publicily available some functions in \hyperlink{wordlist_8h_source}{wordlist.\+h} like those to change the encoding of characters. {\bfseries All the characters stored in memory use the I\+S\+O8859 standard} but characters read from keyboard might follow the U\+TF standard. These functions allow to change from one to another. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
